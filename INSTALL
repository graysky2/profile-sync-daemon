WARNING
To avoid data loss, it is HIGHLY recommended that users stop any running
versions of this software before install updates. Internal changes are
always possible from one release to another.

BUILDING
 Setup the via a make.

 $ make

 Running a `make install` as root will distribute the files to the filesystem.

 # make install

 Note that it is not required in many case, but on ocassion, internals are
 changed in the psd code which makes users stopping any active psd session
 BEFORE the make install setup a good idea.

 Users of Arch/Chakra/Antergos and graysky's PPA (Ubuntu/Debian) do not
 need to worry about this as the respective package managers will do
 this for you. The Fedora packages should also have this built it.
