BUILDING
 Setup the via a make.

  $ make

 Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to
 the file system. Most users will want to select from three options
 depending on target init system (do not run all three)!

	# make install-openrc-all
	# make install-systemd-all
	# make install-upstart-all

 As of v5.29, systemd installations no longer install the deprecated
 cron script instead using a systemd timer instead. Users may override
 and install the deprecated cron script by running:
 `make install-cron` then `make install-systemd-all` if desired.

 Note that the cron script is only deprecated for systemd installs;
 it is still recommended for users of both upstart or openrc.
