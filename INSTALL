BUILDING
 Several options are present in the Makefile. Most users can safely
 ignore them leaving the defaults. User of NixOS not using the distro
 provided package for psd should enable the NIXOS_MAN option to get
 a NixOS customized man page for example.

 Setup the via a make.

  $ make

 Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to
 the file system. Most users will want to select from three options
 depending on target init system (do not run all three)!

	# make install-openrc-all
	# make install-systemd-all
	# make install-upstart-all

 As of v5.29, systemd installations no longer install the deprecated
 cron script instead using a systemd timer. Users may override and
 install the deprecated cron script by running: `make install-cron`
 then `make install-systemd-all` if desired.

 Note that the cron script is only deprecated for systemd installs;
 it is still recommended for users of both upstart or openrc.

 Or build themselves using the included Makefile.ubuntu and debian
 build tools such as dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage. Note in this
 case the scripts in common/debian.  Of particular interest is
 the fact that Ubuntu/Debian use different paths for both their
 lock files and for their default mounted tmpfs paths. See
 common/debian/postinst for the changes.
