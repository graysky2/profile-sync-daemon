Added support for opera-next.  Thanks to FarStar07 for the suggestion.

v3.0
14-Jan-2012
Added support for users to select which browser to sync should multiple profiles be install.  Very useful if one rarely uses a particular browser and does not want to actively page it out to tmpfs.  Thanks to hasufell for this suggestion and patch!

v2.9
14-Jan-2012
Added support for google-chrome and a psd.service for systemd.  Thanks to crabman for the suggestions.

v2.8
13-Jan-2012
Corrected a typeo in /etc/rc.d/psd

v2.7
12-Jan-2012
Fixed to work with asymmetrical user/homedirs.  In other words, if user foo has assigned to it /home/bar as its homedir, psd is now smart enough to know this.  Previous version acted under the assumption that the user name and corresponding home directory were symmetrical in that they were the same, e.g. user foo has /home/foo as its homedir.  This caused breakage.  Thanks to masteryod for reporting this to me in the discussion thread: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=131321&p=2

v2.6
09-Jan-2012
Wrote a manpage and removed the "restart" function since it really has no place in this package.

v2.5
12-Dec-2011
Added support for midori and migrated source from github to repo-ck.com.

v2.4
11-Dec-2011
Switched source tarball from gz to xz and removed some spaces in the package function.

v2.3
09-Dec-2011
Now auto-recovers stale files/links due to a system crashes or other ungraceful states. Thanks to therico for this suggestion.  Also added a script to run hourly via cron rather than forcing the user to write an entry in root's crontab.
