v2.8
13-Jan-2012

v2.7
12-Jan-2012
Fixed to work with asymmetrical user/homedirs.  In other words, if user foo has assigned to it /home/bar as its homedir, psd is now smart enough to know this.  Previous version acted under the assumption that the user name and corresponding home directory were symmetrical in that they were the same, e.g. user foo has /home/foo as its homedir.  This caused breakage.  Thanks to masteryod for reporting this to me in the discussion thread: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=131321&p=2
