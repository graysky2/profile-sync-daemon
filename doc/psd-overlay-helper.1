.SH NAME
\fBpsd-overlay-helper \fP- Script enabling the "profile-sync-daemon" to use an 'overlay' file system in order to reduce the amount of writing operations.
\fB
.SH DESCRIPTION
Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage browser profile(s) in a 'tmpfs' file system and to periodically sync back to the main file system (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished by an innovative use of rsync to maintain synchronization between a copy on a tmpfs and media-bound backup of the browser profile(s). Additionally, psd hass several crash-recovery features.

The psd-overlay-helper script is used internally to enable the usage of the 'overlay' file system. It should not be called by the user directly.
