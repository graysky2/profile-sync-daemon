.SH NAME
\fBprofile-sync-daemon \fP- Symlinks and syncs browser profiles to RAM (tmpfs) thus reducing HDD/SDD calls and speeding-up browsers.
\fB
.SH DESCRIPTION
Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage browser \fBprofile\fP(s) in tmpfs and to periodically sync back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization between the two. Additionally, psd features several crash recovery features.
.PP
Design goals of psd:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
Completely transparent user experience.
.IP \(bu 3
Reduced wear to physical discs (particularly SSDs).
.IP \(bu 3
Speed.
.RE
.PP
Since the \fBprofile\fP(s), browser cache*, etc. are relocated into tmpfs (RAM disk), the corresponding onslaught of I/O associated with using the browser is also redirected from the physical disc to RAM, thus reducing wear to the physical disc and also greatly improving browser speed and responsiveness. For example, the access time of RAM is on the order of nanoseconds while the access time of physical discs is on the order of milliseconds. This is a difference of six orders of magnitude or 1,000,000 times faster.
.PP
*Note that some browsers such as Chromium, Google-chrome, Midori, and Rekonq actually keeps their cache directories separately from their browser profile directory. It is not within the scope of profile-sync-daemon to modify this behavior; users are encouraged to modify this behavior. For example, refer to the following url for several work-arounds for the Chrome-based browsers: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chromium_Tips_and_Tweaks#Cache_in_tmpfs
.SH SETUP
User managed settings are defined in /etc/psd.conf.
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
At a minimum, define which \fBuser\fP(s) will have their profiles managed by psd and note that at least one user must be defined.
.IP \(bu 3
Optionally uncomment and define which browsers are to be managed in the BROWSERS array. Note that the default is all browsers unless otherwise defined.
.IP \(bu 3
Optionally define the location of your distro's tmpfs. Do this in the VOLATILE variable.
.IP \(bu 3
Optionally define the location of your distro's /run. Do this in the DAEMON_FILE variable.
.SH RUNNING PSD
.SS PREVIEW MODE
The preview (parse) option can be called to show users exactly what psd will do based on the entries in /etc/psd.conf.
.PP
.nf

 $ psd p

.SS START AND STOP PSD FOR SYSTEMD USERS
Both a systemd service file and timer are provided, and should be used to interact with psd. BOTH SHOULD BE INVOKED TOGETHER. The role of the timer is update the tmpfs copies back to the disk. This occurs once per hour by default. Failure to start the resync timer will result in the profile being sync'ed only on start up and shutdown.
.PP
.nf

 # systemctl [option] psd psd-resync

Available options:

start
Turn on daemon.
.TP

stop
Turn off daemon.
.TP
.B
enable
Autostart daemon on boot-up.
.TP
.B
disable
Don't autostart daemon on boot-up.
.SS  START AND STOP PSD FOR USERS OF OTHER INIT SYSTEMS
For distros not using systemd, another init script should be used to manage the daemon. Examples are provided and are known to work with the following distros: Debian, Mint, Gentoo, and Ubuntu. Note that for these distros, the supplied cron script (installed to /etc/cron.hourly) will run the resync option to keep the tmpfs copies sync'ed. Of course, the target system must have cron installed and active for this to happen.

Note that the Debian, Mint, and Ubuntu provided packages will create symlinks to start this daemon on boot-up automatically. Disable via the update-rc.d script:

.SS CAVEATS FOR FIREFOX AND ITS KIN
The way psd keeps track of browser profiles and sync targets requires users to have unique name as the last directory for all profiles in their respective $HOME/.mozilla/<browser>/profiles.ini. Psd will check for this and refuse to run if this condition is unsatisfied.
.PP
The following is an example of a BAD profile that will not pass the test. Note that although each full path is unique, they both END in the same name! Again, users must modify the profiles.ini and the corresponding directory on the filesystem to correct this.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
 $ cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini

 [General]
 StartWithLastProfile=1

 [Profile0 for user facade]
 Name=normal
 IsRelative=0
 Path=/mnt/data/docs/facade/mozilla/firefox/myprofile.abc
 Default=1

 [Profile1 for user happy]
 Name=proxy
 IsRelative=0
 Path=/mnt/data/docs/happy/mozilla/firefox/myprofile.abc

.RS
.IP \(bu 3
It is known that on slow systems with large profiles, the sync'ing step sometimes take longer than the boot-up of the WM. Therefore, users can theoretically start their browser before the profile has been transitioned to tmpfs. This is particularly prevalent on systems with slow HDDs running systemd. This effect can be exacerbated with excessively large profiles that store mail as well as browser profiles.
.IP \(bu 3
Currently, psd does not work with encrypted home directories.
