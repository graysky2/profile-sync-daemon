.SH NAME
\fBprofile-sync-daemon \fP- Symlinks and syncs browser profiles to RAM (tmpfs) thus reducing HDD/SSD calls and speeding-up browsers.
\fB
.SH DESCRIPTION
Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage browser \fBprofile\fP(s) in tmpfs and to periodically sync back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished by an innovative use of rsync to maintain synchronization between a tmpfs copy and media-bound backup of your browser \fBprofile\fP(s). Additionally, psd features several crash recovery features.
.PP
Design goals of psd:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
Completely transparent user experience.
.IP \(bu 3
Reduced wear to physical discs (particularly SSDs).
.IP \(bu 3
Speed.
.RE
.PP
Since the \fBprofile\fP(s), browser cache*, etc. are relocated into tmpfs (RAM disk), the corresponding onslaught of I/O associated with using the browser is also redirected from the physical disc to the RAM, thus reducing wear to the physical disc and also greatly improving browser responsiveness. For example, the access time of RAM is on the order of nanoseconds while the access time of physical discs is on the order of milliseconds. This is a difference of six orders of magnitude or 1,000,000 times faster.
.PP
*Note that some browsers such as Chrome/Chromium, Firefox (since v21), Midori, and Rekonq actually keeps their cache directories separately from their browser profile directory. It is not within the scope of profile-sync-daemon to modify this behavior; users wishing to relocate this directory, may refer to the following url for several work-arounds: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chromium_Tips_and_Tweaks#Cache_in_tmpfs
.SH SETUP
/etc/psd.conf contains all user managed settings.
.PP
WARNING -- Do NOT change anything in /etc/psd.conf while psd is running since data loss may occur! Any edits made to the file while psd is running will be applied only after psd has been restarted from the init service.
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
At a minimum, define which \fBuser\fP(s) will have their profiles managed by psd and note that at least one user must be defined.
.IP \(bu 3
Optionally uncomment and define which browsers are to be managed in the BROWSERS array. Note that the default is all browsers unless otherwise defined.
.IP \(bu 3
Optionally define the location of your distro's tmpfs. Do this in the VOLATILE variable.
.IP \(bu 3
Optionally define the location of your distro's /run. Do this in the DAEMON_FILE variable.
.SH RUNNING PSD
.SS PREVIEW MODE
The preview (parse) option can be called to show users exactly what psd will do based on the entries in /etc/psd.conf.

.SS START AND STOP PSD FOR SYSTEMD USERS
Both a systemd service file and timer are provided, and should be used to interact with psd. BOTH SHOULD RUN TOGETHER!
.PP
The role of the timer is update the tmpfs copies back to the disk. This occurs once per hour by default. Failure to start the resync timer will result in the profile being sync'ed only on start up and shutdown.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
 # systemctl [option] psd psd-resync

Available options:

stop
Turn off daemon.
.TP
.B
enable
Autostart daemon on boot-up.
.TP
.B
disable
Don't autostart daemon on boot-up.
.SS  START AND STOP PSD FOR USERS OF OTHER INIT SYSTEMS
For distros not using systemd, another init script should be used to manage the daemon. Examples are provided and are known to work with the following distros: Debian, Mint, Gentoo, and Ubuntu. Note that for these distros, the supplied cron script (installed to /etc/cron.hourly) will run the resync option to keep the tmpfs copies sync'ed. Of course, the target system must have cron installed and active for this to happen.

.SS CAVEATS FOR FIREFOX AND ITS KIN
The way psd keeps track of browser profiles and sync targets requires users to have unique name as the last directory for all profiles in their respective $HOME/.mozilla/<browser>/profiles.ini. Psd will check for this and refuse to run if this condition is unsatisfied.
.PP
The following is an example of a BAD profile that will not pass the test. Note that although each full path is unique, they both END in the same name! Again, users must modify the profiles.ini and the corresponding directory on the filesystem to correct this.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
 $ cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini

 [General]
 StartWithLastProfile=1

 [Profile0 for user facade]
 Name=normal
 IsRelative=0
 Path=/mnt/data/docs/facade/mozilla/firefox/myprofile.abc
 Default=1

.SH FAQ
Q1: My system crashed and didn't sync back. What do I do?
.PP
A1: Odds are the "last good" backup of your browser profiles is just fine still sitting happily on your filesystem. Upon restarting psd (on a reboot for example), a check is preformed to see if the symlink to the tmpfs copy of your profile is invalid. If it is invalid, psd will snapshot the "last good" backup before it rotates it back into place. This is more for a sanity check that psd did no harm and that any data loss was a function of something else.
.PP
Q2: Where can I find this snapshot?
.PP
A2: It depends on the browser. You will find the snapshot in the same directory as the browser profile and it will contain a date-time-stamp that corresponds to the time at which the recovery took place. For example, chromium will be ~/.config/chromium-backup-crashrecovery-20130912_153310 -- of course, the date_time suffix will be different for you.
.PP
Q3: How can I restore the snapshot?
.PP
A3: Follow these steps:
.RS
.IP 1. 4
Stop psd.
.IP 2. 4
Confirm that there is no symlink to the tmpfs browser profile directory. If there is, psd did not stop correctly for other reasons.
.IP 3. 4
Move the "bad" copy of the profile to a backup (don't blindly delete anything).
.IP 4. 4
Copy the snapshot directory to the name that browser expects.
.PP
Example using chromium:
.IP 3. 4
mv ~/.config/chromium ~/.config/chromium-bad
.IP 4. 4
cp \fB-a\fP ~/.config/chromium-backup-crashrecovery-20130912_153310 ~/.config/chromium
.RE
.PP
At this point you can launch chromium which will use the backup snapshot you just copied into place. If all is well, close the browser and restart psd and psd-resync (if using systemd). You may safely delete ~/.config/chromium-backup-crashrecovery-20130912_153310 at this point.

.SH BUGS

.RS
.IP \(bu 3
It is known that on slow systems with large profiles, the sync'ing step sometimes take longer than the boot-up of the WM. Therefore, users can theoretically start their browser before the profile has been transitioned to tmpfs. This is particularly prevalent on systems with slow HDDs running systemd. This effect can be exacerbated with excessively large profiles that store mail as well as browser profiles.
.IP \(bu 3
Currently, psd does not work with encrypted home directories.
